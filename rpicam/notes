libcamerasrc doesn't work with ubuntu 22.04, but requires debian trixie..
debian trixie it works... also with CSI cameras

dual pipeline with tee element works to stream images to ROS and via tcp.
Atm it works with raw images ,but should also work with jpegs..

Think about integrating this properly.


TODO:

debian trixie:
compile libcamerasrc (as currently on the main branch)

add ros2 humble to it (not sure how to do it)
add gscam to it with custom pipeline

done.
